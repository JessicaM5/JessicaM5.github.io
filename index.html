    <p style= color:white;family-font:verdana;text-align:center> At Number one we have <b>Shingeki No Kyojin (Attack On Titan)</b> This anime starts off with a calm day and an even calmer atmosphere, but is then twisted and turned into a day of countless death and destruction(and all before breakfast!) further on in the Anime little snitbits from earlier episodes will give you the greatest "AHA!" and "AH NO!" moments you will ever experience, just. Don't go around biting your thumb when you get the urge to hit someone..

    <p style= color:white;font-family:verdana;font-size:80%> <i><b>ONE PUNCH!</b></i> This anime has an awesome yet short storline and it is hilarious. The main character <b>Saitama</b> In his own series called <b> One Punch Man</b> Is well, A hero who kills everything in One Punch. You would assume a Hero with that much Strength would want to rule the world. but not Saitama, he wants to find a fight that will not only excite him but at least give him the pleasure of not killing any and everything in One Punch.</p>

    <p style= color:red;font-family:verdana;text-align:center;><i>Mirrai Nikki, A watch at your own risk anime filled with Insanity,Weird sense of love and most of all murder. Lots of Murder,enough to make you want to personally ask japan. "WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?!" Main Character <b>Yuki</b> suddenly gets a phone similar to his own with text messages called <b>Future Diaries</b> From there Yuki's life is thrown into a downward spiraling mess, care to join him?</i>

    <p style= color:red;font-family:verdana;text-alig:center;><i><b>BloodC</b></i> is a <b>MESSED UP</b> Anime, all I can say is this Anime is not for the faint of heart or even those with a weak stomach. If you are <b>SURE</b> that you can handle watching a person get eaten on a skewer than be my guest :D!</p>
